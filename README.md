🚨 Problem Statement

Industrial workplaces continue to suffer fatal accidents and severe injuries due to non-compliance with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

Despite regulations, enforcement today is:
	•	Manual
	•	Reactive
	•	Post-incident
	•	Error-prone

Supervisors cannot continuously monitor hundreds of workers across multiple zones in real time.

⸻

💡 Solution Overview

PROTEX is an AI-driven, real-time PPE compliance system that uses computer vision + intelligent profiling to:
	•	Detect PPE violations from video feeds
	•	Apply role-based safety policies
	•	Log compliance events with timestamps
	•	Score workers dynamically
	•	Alert admins only when action is required

This shifts safety enforcement from reactive → predictive → preventive.

⸻

🧠 Key Innovations

1️⃣ Role- & Zone-Aware PPE Intelligence

Unlike generic PPE detectors, PROTEX understands context:

Zone / Role	Mandatory PPE
Factory Floor	Helmet, Gloves, Vest
Chemical Lab	Helmet, Goggles, Mask, Gloves, Vest
Warehouse	Gloves, Vest
Maintenance	Helmet, Gloves

The AI decision engine evaluates only relevant PPE, avoiding false positives.

⸻

2️⃣ Explainable AI Safety Decisions

Every violation is backed by:
	•	Detected PPE
	•	Missing PPE
	•	Zone policy
	•	Time duration
	•	Warning count impact

This makes decisions auditable and regulator-friendly.

⸻

3️⃣ Intelligent Warning System
	•	Each violation increments warnings
	•	>2 warnings auto-flags the worker
	•	Entire row is highlighted for instant admin attention
	•	Prevents alert fatigue

⸻

4️⃣ Dual Dashboard Architecture

👷 Worker Dashboard
	•	Personalized safety score
	•	Historical compliance log
	•	Reward-driven safety incentives

🧑‍💼 Admin Dashboard
	•	Real-time compliance overview
	•	Worker-wise PPE status
	•	Live alerts
	•	Timestamped safety events
	•	Video demo walkthrough
	•	One-click worker profiling

⸻

5️⃣ Gamified Safety Scoring Engine

Workers are rewarded, not just penalized:
	•	Missing PPE → score deduction
	•	Verified compliance → score stability
	•	Long-term compliance → benefits & incentives

This increases adoption and behavioral change.
